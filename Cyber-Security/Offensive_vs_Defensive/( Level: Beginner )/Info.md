# Offensive vs Defensive — Short Answer

**Question:** Which option best represents the process where you simulate a hacker's actions to find vulnerabilities in a system?

**Answer:** **Offensive Security** (Penetration Testing / Red‑Teaming)

**Why (brief):**
Simulating an attacker's actions to discover vulnerabilities is an active, offensive process. Defensive security focuses on prevention, detection and response, while offensive security emulates attackers to reveal weaknesses.

**Notes:**
This was a conceptual question — no hands‑on testing was performed for this answer.
