## Proof & Verification (Redacted)

I completed the Phishing Pond (Easy) room on TryHackMe. After performing the required steps in the room I obtained a completion code (flag) and submitted it in the TryHackMe answer box to mark the task as completed.

### How the proof was obtained
I followed the exercise instructions, captured the relevant HTTP response using Burp Suite or browser developer tools, and located the completion code inside the response body. This was a conceptual/evidence step only â€” no sensitive credentials or private data were accessed.

### Public (redacted) evidence
I do **not** publish raw flags, credentials, or secret tokens. Instead I provide safe, redacted evidence in the public repo, for example:
- a short redacted excerpt from the response (shown below)  
- a blurred screenshot or redacted text on request
