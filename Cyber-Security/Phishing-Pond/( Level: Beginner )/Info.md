## Proof & Verification (Redacted)

I completed the Phishing Pond (Easy) room on TryHackMe. After performing the required steps in the room I received a completion code (flag) which I submitted in the TryHackMe answer box (Submit Flag).

### Public (redacted) evidence
I do **not** publish raw flags or secrets. Instead, I provide safe evidence:
- a redacted example of the response (below)  
- a blurred screenshot in `writeups/phishing-pond/screenshots/` (if available)  
- a redacted text file in `writeups/phishing-pond/artifacts/example-output.txt`
